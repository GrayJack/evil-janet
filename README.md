# evil-janet

This is a rust crate providing low level bindings to the [janet](https://janet-lang.org/) C API.

# versioning scheme

The package major and minor versions follow the janet releases the
bundled headers are compatible with. The patch version may, but does
not necessarily match the janet release.

# feature flags

if the feature link-amalg is enabled, the crate will link the compiled
janet amalgamation, otherwise this crate is header only, which is useful
for building standalone janet modules.

# safety

This crate makes no attempt memory safety.
It is the bare minimum required to use the janet api from
rust. Higher level crates may come in the future.
